# PGHA Scraper
Could I have done this manually? Yes. Am I just lazy and wanted an excuse to add another project to the list? Yes.  
This simply scrapes the PGHA site for the payment standards and puts them in a neat json file.  
Made for those that are lazy like me!!!!

Automatically fetches zip codes too! So it should stay up to date as long as paths are kept to standard.
